RedNeckEngineering_ArcadeMode

Adds a hullmod with:\
x extra seconds of PPT\
x CR Degradation multiplier\
Supplies maintenance per month multiplied by x\
Fuel usage multiplied by x\
Supply usage to deploy a ship into combat multiplied by x\
Cargo storage increased by x\
Fuel storage increased by x\
Crew capacity increased by x

All of these values can be modified on the LunaLib settings in the main menu, without the need to reload the game.

I just wanted to take my time doing stuff in SS without worrying about the ships resources (maintenance and fuel), and here we are!
